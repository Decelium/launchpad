# Decelium Launchpad

[Decelium](https://www.decelium.com/) is a decentralized web hosting service. This repository contains tutorials to get you started using Decelium with a variety of kinds of web sites. The examples use React, Unity and Ethereum smart contracts. At the end of these tutorials you will have have an understanding of using the decentralized web with several important web technologies. 

Each directory folder contains a tutorial in the README.md file, and a subdirectory `final` which shows the final state of the project obtained after completing the tutorial.


## Tutorials

[**FirstReactApp**](./FirstReactApp/README.md) - Use the JavaScript UI-design library React to create a website showing the rotating React logo, and deploy it on Decelium.

[**UnityCube**](./UnityCube/README.md) - Use the Unity 3D Engine to create and render a scene showing a cube on a landscape and build it in a format suitable for it to be deployed on Decelium.

[**FirstDApp**](./FirstDApp/README.md) - A decentralized app (dApp) in which you create and deploy an Ethereum smart contract with a variable stored on the blockchain, and create web and command-line interfaces using JavaScript to get and set the variable's value. The smart contract is written in the Ethereum smart contract language Solidity. The web interface is deployed on Decelium.

[**CryptocurrencyFaucet**](./CryptocurrencyFaucet/README.md) - Write and deploy an Ethereum smart contract and a JavaScript-based web interface to create your own cryptocurrency and mint funds from the currency to a website visitor. The smart contract is written in the Ethereum smart contract language Solidity. The web interface is deployed on Decelium.

[**NFT**](./NFT/README.md) - Write and deploy an Ethereum smart contract and a JavaScript-based web interface that allows visitors to issue themselves non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing items in a video game. The smart contract is written in the Ethereum smart contract language Solidity. The web interface is deployed on Decelium.
